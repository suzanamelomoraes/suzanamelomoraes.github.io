                        <h2>Control flow and Loops </h2>
                        <p>Control flow is in computer science the order that the instructions or statements or
                            functions are executed. In javascript, we read the code starting from the first line till
                            the last line unless of course in the code there is some instructions or statements that
                            changes that control flow.</p>
                        <p>The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the
                            order that they appear. Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by
                            employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally
                            execute particular blocks of code.</p>
                        <p>Loops are a big part of control flow statement. They are the primary mechanism for telling a
                            computer to perform the same task over and over again until a set of criteria are met. </p>
                        <p>All programming languages need ways of doing similar things many times, this is called
                            iteration. Loops allow a block of statements to be executed repeatedly without actually
                            writing them down numerous times. This is where for, while and do ... while loops are of
                            use.</p>
                        <p>In a loop structure, the loop asks a question. If the answer requires action, it is executed.
                            The same question is asked again and again until no further action is required. Each time
                            the question is asked is called an iteration.</p>
                        <p>You can think, for example, when you are thirsty. You are human, and as a human is natural
                            you feel thirsty every day, and you need to drink water. This is a statement. So then in
                            some part of you day, you feel you are thirsty. This is the trigger, the question. Your is
                            true. You want to drink water until you are satisfied and you will stop when this condition
                            became false. All the time you feel thirsty, you will drink water again, until you match the
                            condition to be satisfied. </p>
