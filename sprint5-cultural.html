                        <h2>Foundations Core Skills</h2>
                        <p>The Core Skills of my foundations journey was a pleasant surprise.</p>
                        <p>At the first moment you can ask yourself: What it means? I came here to learn how to code!
                            It is true, but all the Core's content are helpful, actually crucial to me to learn how to
                            code, and how to code well, especially because it is not only about code, but how you are
                            going to do to solve it.
                        </p>
                        <p>Yes, the first thing I have learned with DevAcademy and its core stuff is: the tech marked
                            does not want developers to write codes, they want us to sort problems. So, I needed to
                            learn how to do it and do it well. Actually, I am still learning but it is worth a lot.</p>
                        <p>The second important thing I have learnt was, I did know how to study. The Core brought me
                            invaluable techniques that just saved my life forever. I need to assume it is still hard for
                            me. It is challenging to have focus and discipline, but the results are so amazing that I
                            definitely will use that for the rest of my life.</p>
                        <p>The third but not the last one was about my mindset to learn. How to have a growth mind and
                            how important it is.</p>
                        <p>All information and techniques learnt are not so important to my learning time but also to my
                            future as a developer. I can clearly see all the advantages to use then as professional, how
                            to solve problems, how to work well and efficiently using timekeeping techniques and also to
                            have a growth mindset and developer an emotional intelligence to deal with difficult tasks
                            and colleagues. </p>
                        <p>This is an invaluable knowledge that is not taught in the college and it is something that
                            usually we spend years to learn from the market. Definitely, the foundations core skills
                            brought me knowledge that will make a difference in my life.</p>
