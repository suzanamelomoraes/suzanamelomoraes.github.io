                        <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>

                        <p> <strong>Neuroplasticity</strong> is defined as the selective organising of connections
                            between neurons in our brains. It makes your brain extremely resilient and is the process by which all permanent
                            learning takes place in your brain.</p>
                        <p>Well, but what it means?</p>
                        <p>Neuroplasticity makes your brain extremely resilient and is the process by which all
                            permanent learning takes place in your brain. This is amazing once now we know that we don't
                            need born as genius to do anything we want, we just need to practice it!</p>
                        <p>Mental practice it is an effective way to prepare your body for a physical skill. Each though
                            you have about something you are learning change the structure and function of your brain by
                            affecting the neuronios at a microscopic level. </p>
                        <p>When we repeatedly practice an activity or access a memory, we make changes in our brains and
                            our neural networks ( groups of neurons that fire together, creating electrochemical
                            pathways ) shape themselves according to that activity or memory. </p>
                        <p>This also explains why we forget new things easier than thing that we have been practicing
                            for a long time. It happens because when people stop practicing new things, the brain also
                            starts to eliminate the connecting cells that formed the pathways, something like "I don't
                            use it, I don't need it, let me through into the rubbish bin". On the other hand, practice
                            strengthens the connections between those cells.</p>
                        <p>So, how to use it in benefit of ourselves?</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Practice everything you want to learn or strengthen your knowledge. Repeating an
                                activity,
                                retrieving a memory, and reviewing material in a variety of ways helps build thicker,
                                stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain.</li><br>
                            <li>Find relationship between new and old concepts you already have. Put information in
                                context.
                                The brain will work faster when on already-existing pathways than creating a new one.
                                When
                                the new material is presented in such a way that the brain see relationships between
                                concepts it improves the long-term retaining.</li><br>
                            <li>Be aware that you can do everything you want. Once you know how things work in your
                                brain,
                                you can use it in your benefit to achieve an effective results. You don't need to be a
                                genius to learn something new or achieve a goal, you just need to make your brain work
                                in an
                                effective way. How? Don't give up and don't think it is hard, what you need is practice,
                                practice and practice.</li>
                        </ul>




                        <p>We know that even practicing, start something new (and we know it can happen inside something
                            we are already practicing, such as a new topic) can be hard and challenging. So, how to keep
                            going when we find such a challenging situation?</p>
                        <p>Well, have you heard about <strong>Growth Mindset</strong>?</p>
                        <p>Your mindset has a crucial character here as it is simple as: What are going to think when
                            you find a challenge? I can not do it or what I can learn from it? Did you see the
                            difference between these two ways to think and the effects of that on you behaviour?</p>
                        <p>The first one is more closely to a “fixed mindset” that assumes that our character,
                            intelligence, and creative ability are static givens which we can’t change in any meaningful
                            way. It will make you run far from hard and difficult situations. Striving for success and
                            avoiding failure at all costs become a way of maintaining the sense of being smart or
                            skilled.</p>
                        <p>The second question, on the other hand, it is an example of a “growth mindset,” and it sees
                            failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for
                            stretching our abilities. It turns out, if you believe your brain can grow, you behave
                            differently.</p>
                        <p>People who believe their talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and
                            input from others tend to achieve more than those who believe their talents are innate
                            gifts. This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into
                            learning. A growth mindset makes you empowered and committed.</p>
                        <p>Well, but we know it is not so easy, we all have our own fixed-mindset triggers. When we face
                            challenges, receive criticism, or fare poorly compared with others, we can easily fall into
                            insecurity or defensiveness. We must identify and work with these triggers.</p>
                        <p>I can tell you that because I have a lot of them and I also fight then every day. I moved to
                            New Zealand five years ago, from today, with no English and I could not afford a course to
                            learn English to do the IELTS (English proficiency test) test I needed. I studied by myself
                            by online courses and book as I needed to get a mark of 5. Well, I got a 7. Now I am 42
                            years old starting a new graduation and I know I can do it, even though I am aware it will
                            be not easier at all.</p>
                        <p>So, I am sure you already had a challenge in your life and you fight it successfully, which
                            means you had a growth mindset at that time and you even knew it. So do I, but know I know
                            and I really intent to use it in my favor, now with conscious about what I am doing. Are you
                            keen to do it with me?</p>
