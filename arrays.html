                        <h2>The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
                        <p>Let's start first understanding the difference between Arrays and Objects.</p>
                        <p>Objects represent “elements” with properties, while arrays create and store lists of data in
                            a single variable. Both dot and bracket notation allow us to access, add, change, and remove
                            items from an object, while zero-based indexing and a variety of built-in methods let us
                            access and alter items in an array. </p>
                        <p>Did you think is this too complicated to understand?</p>
                        <p>So, well. We can think an Array as a wall full of mailboxes identified from the number 0
                            until 99, for example, it will be 100 in total. All of them have contents and for you access
                            the correct content you need to know which is the correct mailbox number. </p>
                        <p>
                            It should be something like:<br>
                        mailbox [0,1,2,3… and so on].</p>
                        <p>So now, let's put this wall inside a big room. Imagine that this big room is full of cages
                            and this wall
                            is inside of one of these cages. Each of these cages are identified by names or properties
                            and they have different contents or names values inside in different sizes including big
                            boxes, cars, fourniture and also walls with mail boxes. The key to access those values are
                            their names.</p>
                        </p>So you can think about something like this:</p>
                        <p>
                            bigRoom{<br>
                            &nbspcage 1 {<br>
                            &nbsp &nbsp box1: books,<br>
                            &nbsp &nbsp box2: glasses,<br>
                            &nbsp &nbsp mailbox1 [0,1,2,3… and so on]<br>
                            &nbsp}<br>
                            &nbspcage2 : pickupFord,<br>
                            &nbspcage3 {<br>
                            &nbsp &nbsp mailbox1 [0,1,2,3… and so on]<br>
                            &nbsp &nbsp }<br>
                            }<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>Maybe now you can better understand this concept: Objects are used to represent a "thing”
                            in your code and these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a
                            value. While talking about coding, properties in objects can be accessed, added, changed,
                            and removed by using either dot or bracket notation. <br>For example: bigRoom.cage1.box1 or
                            bigRoom[cage2].</p>
                        <p>Objects are best when you want to organize based on data labels. When you read a newspaper,
                            you likely do not read it front to back, page by page. You flip to a certain section based
                            on the section’s name. No matter where that section is located in the newspaper, you can
                            flip to it immediately and have the appropriate context. </p>
                        <p>You want to use arrays when order is the most important factor for organizing the
                            information, like a book, where the order of the chapters/sections matters.</p>
                        <p>We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single
                            variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the
                            collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list, like the mail boxes.
                            Just as object properties can store values of any primitive data type, so too can arrays
                            consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays.</p>
                        <p>Arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first item in an array has an index of 0, the second
                            item an index of 1, and so on.</p>
                        <p>A general rule of thumb is that if you need to store a collection of properties of varying
                            types, use an object. Otherwise, use an array.</p>
