                        <h2>What's the difference between Padding, Border and Margin?</h2>
                        <img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c878e8a880644d3a5b06c2f517db7e5a"
                            alt="Box showing margin, border, padding and content block" class="responsive">
                        <p>One of the first things I get struggled to understand with no technology background was the
                            difference between Padding, Border and Margin. Now I know that is that while padding deals
                            with the inner space (the space between an element content and the border), margin deals
                            with the outer space (the space outside of the element) to the next outer element. </p>
                        <p>But, what it means to you if you are just reading that for the first time?</p>
                        <p>Let's check the official definition about W3C - World Wide Web Consortium - I would say that
                            those guys created almost everything we are suading just now, the definitions, rules, and
                            they are still doing it. Just now. </p>
                        <p>By W3C:<br>"All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is
                            used when
                            talking about design and layout. <br>
                            The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of:
                            margins, borders, padding, and the actual content." </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <strong>Content</strong> - The content of the box, where text and images appear</li>
                            <li><strong>Padding</strong> - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Border </strong> - A border that goes around the padding and content</li>
                            <li> <strong>Margin</strong> - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Ok, so now as a good developer you want to be, let's broken it in small parts.
                            So have a look at the image and come back here. <br>
                            Did you see the Padding?
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, let's think about the box as W3C explained to us. Padding defines the space between an
                            element content and its border. If an element has a border around it, padding will give
                            space from that border to the element content which appears in that border. If an element
                            does not have a border around it, then adding padding has no effect at all on that element,
                            because there is no border to give space from.</p>
                        <p>So padding is a is a CSS property added to elements with borders surrounding them to give
                            space from that border to the element content inside of the border.</p>
                        <p>Ok then, so what is Margin?<br>
                            Margin defines the space of outside of an element to its next outside element.
                        </p>
                        <p>Margin is another CSS property that affects elements that both have or do not have borders.
                            If an element has a border, margin defines the space from this border to the next outer
                            element. If an element does not have a border, then margin defines the space from the
                            element content to the next outer element. </p>
                        <p>So finally, the difference between margin and padding is that while padding deals with the
                            inner space (the space between an element content and the border), margin deals with the
                            outer space (the space outside of the element) to the next outer element.</p>
