                        <h2>Problem Solving techniques</h2>
                        <p>Every week the course became more hard and difficulties become worse as you learn more and
                            more things in a short amount of time and needs to do lots of tasks as we usually use all
                            the resources you have just learnt. </p>
                        <p>I got myself spent hours trying to understand why my code was not working and also ticket all
                            the problem solving suggestions given by the learning programme such as:
                            <br>Pseudocode, trying something, reading error messages, console.logging, googling to
                            finally figure out that I had a spelling mistake.
                        </p>
                        <p>I also became really frustrated when I started a task where I needed to work with strings,
                            and array built-in methods and I realise I was totally unable to go for it. I needed to
                            stop, study the matter to finally complete the tasks. The time box suggested four hours but
                            I spend the whole day.</p>
                        <p>Complete the sprint 4, especially would be impossible without using the problem solving
                            techniques such as Pseudocoding, that involves taking a little time before you get into
                            writing the code to break down your plan into small steps. This can be useful for helping
                            you break down a complicated problem, but can also be used if one developer needs to leave
                            instructions for another to complete the code later.</p>
                        <p>I could also use other techniques such as trying something, reading error messages,
                            console.logging, googling, asking coaches for help and also improving your process with
                            reflection.</p>
                        <p>I made some notes about it and I would like to share with you as I believe it could be used
                            to any circumstances in our lives.</p>

                        <h3>A little bit more about problem solving techniques</h3>

                        <p>A common misconception about coders is that their job is to write code, but it fails to
                            capture the essence of what a coder does, which is to solve problems. When confronted with a
                            problem, most coders’ first instinct is to immediately start writing code, but diving into
                            code without a plan is a trap.</p>
                        <p>Taking the time to understand the problem and structure an effective approach may seem like a
                            time sink, but not only will it lead you to a better solution, it will also save you time in
                            the long run.</p>
                        <p>The first thing you need to do is to understand the problem. This is crucial. If you don’t
                            understand the parameters of the problem then you can’t possibly expect to develop an
                            effective solution. Can you imagine when you get to the end of the code and realize that it
                            doesn’t address the problem?</p>
                        <p>Only after that you can start working through potential solutions and write out pseudocode to
                            describe it. Don't forget to anticipate possible issues. If you identify these cases ahead
                            of time then you can plan for them in your solution. </p>
                        <p>Here are some useful steps to be followed when you need to solve a problem.</p>

                        <h4>1. Understand and Analyse the Problem</h4>
                        <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are you able to understand the question fully?</li>
                            <li>Would you be able to explain the question to another person?</li>
                            <li>What and how many inputs are required?</li>
                            <li> What would be the output for those inputs</li>
                            <li>Can you separate out some modules or parts from the problem?</li>
                            <li>Do you have enough information? If not, try understanding the question again.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>2. Go through the sample inputs and examples thoroughly</h4>
                        <p>Going through some sample inputs and coming up with more examples sure helps you a lot to
                            understand the problem well, and also it gives you a clear way to how many cases your code
                            should handle, and what all can be the possible output or output range.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take very simple examples and find the output</li>
                            <li>Take more complex and bigger inputs to see what will be the output, how many use cases
                                do we want</li>
                            <li>Try out the problem with no input, what should be the output now</li>
                            <li>Try out the problem with invalid input, what should be the output now</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>3. Break down the problem</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Divide the problem into subproblems until you get a step you can sort</li>
                            <li>Try to make independent functions for each sub-problem</li>
                            <li>Connect those sub-problems by calling them in the required order, or as necessary
                                (Probably one function would be calling another)</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>4. Start solving/coding</h4>
                        <p>If you can’t solve the problem fully at once, try writing code for a simpler sub part, as you
                            solve the problem, gradually you keep figuring out the problem in more detail, and you start
                            getting new ideas.</p>

                        <h4>5. Look Back and Learn More</h4>
                        <p>Now, this is the most important part! Once you are done, look back whether the code can be
                            improved, is there any other way to solve the given problem?
                            <br>You can ask yourself:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is there any other way to solve the problem?</li>
                            <li>Is the code efficient? Can it be more efficient?</li>
                            <li>Is the code readable?</li>
                            <li>If someone else showed you this code, would you be able to understand it?</li>
                            <li>Can the performance be improved?</li>

                        </ul>
