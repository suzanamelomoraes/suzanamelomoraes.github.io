                        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>

                        <h3>What is EQ - Emotional Quotient and what is IQ - Intelligence Quotient?</h3>
                        <p>IQ stands indicates a person’s intelligence level. It is a number derived from a standardized
                            intelligence test.<br>
                            Emotional intelligence (EI), emotional leadership (EL), emotional quotient (EQ) and
                            emotional intelligence quotient (EIQ) refers to a person’s ability to understand his/her
                            emotion along with the other person’s
                            emotions or a measure of a person's level of emotional intelligence. This refers to a
                            person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions.
                        </p>

                        <h4>IQ abilities:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Visual and spatial processing</li>
                            <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
                            <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
                            <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
                            <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>EQ abilities:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identifying emotions</li>
                            <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
                            <li>Controlling one's own emotions</li>
                            <li>Perceiving how others feel</li>
                            <li>Using emotions to facilitate social communication</li>
                            <li>Relating to others</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Your IQ is what determines your competencies and individual capacities, but your EQ
                            determines how you interact and treat people in your life, it shows how you are going to
                            cope with pressures or face the crisis. The difference between these two is that no one can
                            alter his/her intelligence or reasoning abilities, but anyone can learn to handle emotions,
                            to bring success for him.</p>

                        <h4>So why Emotional Intelligence is so important?</h4>

                        <p>You might picture someone who never lets his temper get out of control, no matter what
                            problems he's facing. Or you might think of someone who has the complete trust of her staff,
                            listens to her team, is easy to talk to, and always makes careful, informed decisions. This
                            is related with the Emotional intelligence and the ability to understand and manage your own
                            emotions, and those of the people around you. People with a high degree of emotional
                            intelligence know what they're feeling, what their emotions mean, and how these emotions can
                            affect other people.</p>
                        <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to deal with other people successfully. By
                            understanding one's own feelings they can understand and evaluate others. </p>
