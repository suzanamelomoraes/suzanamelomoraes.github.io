                        <h2>What functions are and why they are useful</h2>

                        <p>Even if you never had any contact with codes and development, I believe you are aware that
                            developers programing writing codes right?</p>
                        <p>So well, luckily they don't need to write the same line of code all the time that they need
                            the computer to some task they already asked before. They can "wrap" it, give a name to this
                            pack and call for it how many times they need this code again.</p>
                        <p>Basically, a function is a set of statements that performs some tasks or does some
                            computation and then returns the result to the user.</p>
                        <p>You can think about is as a "subprogram" that can be called by code external (or internal in
                            the case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a function is composed of a
                            sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function, and the
                            function will return a value.</p>
                        <p>In JavaScript, functions are first-class and it is defined with the function keyword,
                            followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().</p>
                        <p>Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as
                            variables).</p>
                        <p>The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:<br>
                            (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
                        </p>
                        <p>The code to be executed by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}</p>
                        <p>Wrapping all: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A function is a subprogram designed to perform a particular task.</li>
                            <li>Functions are executed when they are called. This is known as invoking a function.</li>
                            <li>Values can be passed into functions and used within the function.</li>
                            <li>Functions always return a value. In JavaScript, if no return value is specified, the
                                function will return undefined.</li>
                            <li>Functions are objects (You can read a litle bit more about Objects in my article "The
                                difference between accessing data from Arrays and <a href="arrays.html">Objects</a>").
                            </li>
