                        <p>I am Communications' bachelor with more than 20 years of experience starting a new challenge
                            where I am going to write a totally different thing in my life: codes. </p>
                        <p>Well, why not? </p>
                        <p>I have been involved with it since I got married with a Software Engineer in 2013, but I had
                            no interest in it before, maybe because he works with Java (sorry Java guys but you know
                            this is the not most friendly language for beginners) until my husband looked at me and
                            asked: Have you thought about learning HTML, CSS and JavaScrip? </p>
                        <p>I started to look for information about it and after watching some tutorials about it on You
                            Tube I realised is exactly that I needed and I wanted. </p>
                        <p>Move to another country to start a new and totally different life, including learning a new
                            language is not easier. I am from Brazil and moved to New Zealand in 2014 with no English. I
                            am living in Auckland and on 2nd September 2019 I started a course to graduate as Web
                            Developer on <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz"> Enspiral Dev Academy</a>.</p>
                        <p>So, now I am a Web Developer student and I am sharing a little bit of this adventure.</p>
