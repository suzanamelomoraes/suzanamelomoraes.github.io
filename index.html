                        <h3>What's the difference between Padding, Border and Margin? </h3>
                        <img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c878e8a880644d3a5b06c2f517db7e5a"

                        <p>One of the first things I get struggled to understand with no technology background was the
                            difference between Padding, Border and Margin. Now I know that is that while padding deals
                            with the inner space (the space between an element content and the border), margin deals
                            with the outer space (the space outside of the element) to the next outer element. </p>
                        <p>But, what it means to you if you are just reading that for the first time?</p>
                        <p>Let's check the official definition about W3C - World Wide Web Consortium - I would say that
                            those guys created almost everything we are suading just now, the definitions, rules, and
                            they are still doing it. Just now. To read all my article follow me in my <a

                        <p>Auckland, based around 2 large harbours, is a major city in the north of New Zealand’s North
                            Island. In the centre, the iconic Sky Tower has views of Viaduct Harbour, which is full of
                            superyachts and lined with bars and cafes. Auckland Domain, the city’s oldest park, is based
                            around an extinct volcano and home to the formal Wintergardens. You can find more

                        <p>In Dev Academy you start with a foundations program which one you can choose to complete
                            within 10 weeks studying part-time or full time dedication for 5 weeks.
                            Once completed, you'll join a 9 week experience of intense coding at either in Auckland or
                            Wellington campus. You will be exposed to a variety of modern technologies for full stack
                            web programming.</p>
                        <p>The best thing about it is that you will graduate with a portfolio of projects that you've

                        <p>My first love when I started to understand a little bit about the development's world was
                            Linux. I soon I got married and tried to use my husband's laptop for the first time I just
                            couldn't. Then I learnt how to use it and fell in love.</p>
                        <p>Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most
                            popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An
                            operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your
                            desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between
                            your software and your hardware. Curious about it? Check for more information on <a
