                        <h2>What's the difference between HTML and CSS?</h2>
                        <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Think of HTML as the skeleton of the document. The HTML is what gives structure to the site. This is done through tags, elements, and attributes. Whether you want headings, lists, images, or links, HTML can do all of that.</p>
                        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. If HTML is the skeleton of your page, CSS is the skin.</p>
                        <p>Without CSS, your websites would look naked. In CSS, there is a property and a value. Property is the quality you want to change; value is the amount of change.</p>
                        <p>I would compare HTML and CSS to build a house. You have the foundations of the house where you need to make clear which kind of construction you are going to do. You want to wrap the area, such as we do when typing !DOCTYPE and HTML tags. Then, based on the project you have, you want to define the rest of the structure you want to build, the room's space, where are going to be the living room, bathrooms. Then you start to build the structure, the walls, space for doors and windows, ceiling.</p>
                        <p>When all the structure is ready, you want to style it, and for it, you have the CSS. Which doors and windows, you will choose? What will be the colors of everything? The house can look totally different from the original basic structure depends on what kind of style you decide to put on it.</p>
