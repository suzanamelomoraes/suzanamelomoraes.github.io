                        <h3>Commitments and goals</h3>
                        <h4>Long term goal and career pathway</h4>

                        <p>I intend to become a web developer and use my skills from 20 years of experience as a
                            manager, director of Media,
                            editor and journalist, to improve my tech career, such as team leader, project manager and
                            business analyst.</p>
                        <h4>Non-technical - human skills to develop</h4>

                        <p>I need to improve my time keeping and focus. This is still the hard part for me. I often lose
                            my train of thought
                            or forgot to keep my work inside my planned time and I am aware that keep this discipline is
                            crucial to make my
                            projects become reality inside a well planned workflow.</p>
                        <h4>Strengths and limitations</h4>

                        <p>I am motivated, hard work, positive attitude, strong ethical behaviour and reliable person. I
                            am terrible to
                            organise myself especially about time and keeping focus. I often over time my working time
                            and finish my task
                            stressed and tired.</p>
                        <h4>Commitments and expectations</h4>

                        <p>I will follow the time boxing and I had success using tools l such as pomodoro I believe this
                            is a good technique
                            to be followed to keep my time tracked and productive.</p>

                        <p>Good communication is the key for any project. I should let my facilitator knows I soon as I
                            can when I get
                            struggled or find any difficult. </p>

                        <p>I expect a clear and honest communication between my facilitator and I. If he/she does know
                            the answer I expect
                            help from him/her to guide me to where I can find it.</p>
                        <h4>Workload Management and Scheduling</h4>


                        <p>Full time of dedication to the project, which is to become a Junior Web Developer in 15
                            weeks.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>15 Weeks</li>
                            <li>A minimum of 40 hours per week</li>

                        <p>I am Communications' bachelor with more than 20 years of experience starting a new challenge
                            where I am going to write a totally different thing in my life: codes. </p>
                        <p>Well, why not? </p>
                        <p>I have been involved with it since I got married with a Software Engineer in 2013, but I had
                            no interest in it before, maybe because he works with Java (sorry Java guys but you know
                            this is the not most friendly language for beginners) until my husband looked at me and
                            asked: Have you thought about learning HTML, CSS and JavaScrip? </p>
                        <p>I started to look for information about it and after watching some tutorials about it on You
                            Tube I realised is exactly that I needed and I wanted. </p>
                        <p>Move to another country to start a new and totally different life, including learning a new
                            language is not easier. I am from Brazil and moved to New Zealand in 2014 with no English. I
                            am living in Auckland and on 2nd September 2019 I started a course to graduate as Web
                            Developer on <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz"> Enspiral Dev Academy</a>.</p>
                        <p>So, now I am a Web Developer student and I am sharing a little bit of this adventure.</p>
