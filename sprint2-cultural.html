                        <h3>Commitments and goals</h3>
                        <h4>Long term goal and career pathway</h4>

                        <p>As a web developer I want to also bring to the table my skills from 20 years of experience as
                            a manager, director of Media, editor and journalist, to improve my tech career. I want to
                            use my tech and human skills from knowledge from DevAcademy to build good efficient and
                            reliable projects and also a strong, well balanced and fair partnership with my co-workers.
                            I also want to bring my past and new knowledge to build my pathway to the next steps such as
                            team leader, project manager and business analyst in the tech market.</p>
                        <h4>Non-technical - human skills to develop</h4>

                        <p>I need to improve my time keeping and focus. This is still the hard part for me. I often lose
                            my train of thought or forgot to keep my work inside my planned time and I am aware that
                            keep this discipline is crucial to make my projects become reality inside a well planned
                            workflow.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Strengths and limitations</h4>

                        <p>I am motivated, hard work, positive attitude, strong ethical behaviour and reliable person. I
                            believe this is gonna help my classmates and I united and motivated against challenges. <br>

                            On the other hand, I consider myself terrible to organise my time and also to keep focus. I
                            often over time my working time as I became obsessed to finish my work and get frustrated
                            when I could not finish that as I would like to do and also I used to finish hard tasks
                            stressed and tired.<br>

                            After to complete the foundations program and after so many years of experience how I could
                            feel how much I have improved about this matter. Articles and techniques about focus and
                            timekeeping made absolutely difference on my studying time.<br>

                            I am aware that even though I have improved a lot with limitations such as how to deal with
                            frustrations and timekeeping those things will still be a challenge as we are going to deal
                            with such intense program. It will be a good opportunity to practice all the knowledge I
                            have received from foundations programme. <br>
                            I found myself more productive following the time boxing and using tools such as pomodoro
                            those are good techniques to be followed to keep my time tracked and productive and
                            definitely will be part of my routine at Bootcamp.
                            I am excited with the idea of having mindfulness every day before the bootcamp starts as I
                            want to improve my self awareness.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Commitments and expectations</h4>

                        <p>Good communication is the key for the success of any project. Since from simple things such
                            as let my facilitator knows I soon as I can when I get struggled or when find any difficult,
                            or when get more complicated problem such as having difficult to work in pair with
                            someone.<br>



                            I expect a clear and honest communication between my facilitators and I, if I get struggled
                            with a challenge I am not expecting answers from them, I expect they guide me to where I can
                            find the knowledge to learn by myself and complete my task.</p>
