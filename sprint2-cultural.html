    <h3>Commitments and goals</h3>
    <p>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</p>
    <p>I intend to become a web developer and use my skills from 20 years of experience as a manager, director of Media,
        editor and journalist, to improve my tech career, such as team leader, project manager and business analyst.</p>
    <p>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</p>
    <p>I need to improve my time keeping and focus. This is still the hard part for me. I often lose my train of thought
        or forgot to keep my work inside my planned time and I am aware that keep this discipline is crucial to make my
        projects become reality inside a well planned workflow.</p>
    <p>A description of your own strengths and limitations</p>
    <p>I am motivated, hard work, positive attitude, strong ethical behaviour and reliable person. I am terrible to
        organise myself especially about time and keeping focus. I often over time my working time and finish my task
        stressed and tired.</p>
    <p>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</p>
    <p>I will follow the time boxing and I had success using tools l such as pomodoro I believe this is a good technique
        to be followed to keep my time tracked and productive.</p>
    <p>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</p>
    <p>Good communication is the key for any project. I should let my facilitator knows I soon as I can when I get
        struggled or find any difficult. </p>
    <p>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</p>
    <p>I expect a clear and honest communication between my facilitator and I. If he/she does know the answer I expect
        help from him/her to guide me to where I can find it.</p>
    <p>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</p>
    <p>I planned myself to be totally dedicated, at least 40 hours per week, to this project which is became a Junior
        Web Developer in 15 weeks, from 9am to 5pm or until when it would be necessary.</p>
