                        <h2>DOM (Document Object Model)</h2>
                        <p>By the definition given by W3C:<br>

                            The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows
                            programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a
                            document.
                        </p>
                        <p>DOM is created by the browser when a web page is loaded and is divided into three parts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Core DOM - standard model for all document types</li>
                            <li>XML DOM - standard model for XML documents</li>
                            <li>HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Looking for this matter from JavaScripter's perspective let's keep our focus on HTML DOM.</p>
                        <p>The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.</p>
                        <p>DOM is actually made up of many kinds of things beyond just HTML elements, those things are
                            more generically known as nodes.
                            <br> These nodes can be elements, attributes, text content, comments, document-related
                            stuff, and various other things, but the only kind of notes that matters to us is the
                            element kind.
                        </p>
                        <p>It is also part of the Window object, a global object that contains many properties and
                            methods that help you work with your browser.</p>
                        <p>DOM provides access one level up to your document and window objects and is constructed as a
                            tree of Objects, a hierarchical structure that your browser uses to make sense of everything
                            going on. All of the properties, methods, and events available for manipulating and creating
                            web pages are organized into objects. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the
                            web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript. All of that
                            can be manipulated by JavaScript to create a dynamic HTML.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript can change and remove all the HTML elements and attributes in the page, and also
                            add new ones. JavaScript can change all the CSS styles on the page and also JavaScript can
                            create new HTML events in the page and react to all existing ones. You can construct a fully
                            functioning page using nothing but JavaScript.</p>
