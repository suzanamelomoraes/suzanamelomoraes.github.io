                        <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Activity</h2>

                        <h3>Who are me?</h3>
                        <p>I consider myself a reliable, honest, hard working, brave and motivated person. Of course I
                            am afraid to fail in
                            front of the difficulties, but even I became nervous and anxious, I never stop to fight
                            until I get what I want
                            and do what I believe is the right thing to be done. I’ve learnt that the quote: I prefer
                            peace than be right,
                            it is not correct when it affects the rights of the people around you and yourself.</p>

                        <h3>How is my way of work? What are my strengths? </h3>
                        <p>I believe in respect, equality, harmony, honesty, clear communication and fair distribution
                            of work and tasks. I
                            created a fair and rotative workflow where all of us had the same time of work on all tasks
                            we need to do,
                            sharing days between the nice or the hard ones. I implemented a training programme where all
                            workers are going
                            to receive the same knowledge and all information needed to start to work with their
                            colleagues.</p>
                        <p>I also created a timetable with weekly meetings to discuss problems which we were struggling
                            and where the team
                            could find a solution together. We also used this time to review steps of tasks where we
                            could find issues,
                            discuss new guidelines sent from the central office and give new suggestions for improvement
                            in any area we
                            identified would be necessary to be improved.</p>

                        <h3>Where I need to improve?</h3>

                        <p>I am aware that all of us can learn things and improve ourselves everyday, and one thing I am
                            sure I need to
                            improve is to listen more. Listen to the people around me, my family, my friends, my
                            colleagues. “ Talk less and
                            listen more” is my goal.</p>
                        <p>I am aware that I need to organise my time and keep focus in my tasks. Improve my self
                            discipline is the next
                            step.</p>

                        <h3>What do the people around me think about me?</h3>
                        <h4>Testimonial feedbacks</h4>
                        <blockquote>"I think the most valuable gift you have is your resilience. Perfect quote to
                            describe you would be: “I
                            am not
                            what happened to me. I am what I choose to become.” There is no such a thing as I can’t do.
                            If you decide what
                            you want, you will do whatever it takes to get things done. You are passionate about
                            everything you do, and you
                            are kind with people around you. Your self-awareness allows you to self-correct, doesn’t
                            stop you from making
                            mistakes but challenge you to learn from them. You’re a champion for me."</blockquote>
