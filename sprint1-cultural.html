    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Activity</h1>
    <p>I consider myself a reliable, honest, hard working, brave and motivated person. Of course I am afraid to fail in
        front of the difficulties, but even I became nervous and anxious, I never stop to fight until I get what I want
        and do what I believe is the right thing to be done. I’ve learnt that the quote: I prefer peace than be right,
        it is not correct when it affects the rights of the people around you and yourself.</p>
    <p>I have experienced a situation of bullying and harassment at work where my colleagues and I suffered a lot of
        humiliation by our manager. I decided to be quiet for a lot of reasons such as: I did not want to lose my job
        and I believe if I would do anything to try to stop that situation it would become worse, but one colleague got
        the phone and made a call to our superiors. She related everything what was happening and they started an
        investigation.</p>
    <p>The manager started to receive training and a new team started to work with us. I was looking for another job
        when the manager started to do the same thing again, this time against the new team, and this time I did not
        stay quiet. I did what was right and told my superiors what was happening.</p>
    <p>This manager asked for resignation and I have been invited to replace her position. I had the opportunity to rule
        the office in a way I believed would be better for the team.</p>
    <p>I believe in respect, equality, harmony, honesty, clear communication and fair distribution of work and tasks. I
        created a fair and rotative workflow where all of us had the same time of work on all tasks we need to do,
        sharing days between the nice or the hard ones. I implemented a training programme where all workers are going
        to receive the same knowledge and all information needed to start to work with their colleagues.</p>
    <p>I also created a timetable with weekly meetings to discuss problems which we were struggling and where the team
        could find a solution together. We also used this time to review steps of tasks where we could find issues,
        discuss new guidelines sent from the central office and give new suggestions for improvement in any area we
        identified would be necessary to be improved.</p>
    <p>As a result, the office became a place where in the past, the colleague who spent the most time working there
        stayed for only six months, but after me as team leader, the youngest worker in the team was working there for
        more than a year.</p>
    <p>I am aware that all of us can learn things and improve ourselves everyday, and one thing I am sure I need to
        improve is to listen more. Listen to the people around me, my family, my friends, my colleagues. “ Talk less and
        listen more” is my goal.</p>


    <h2>Testimonial feedbacks</h2>
    <p>"I think the most valuable gift you have is your resilience. Perfect quote to describe you would be: “I am not
        what happened to me. I am what I choose to become.” There is no such a thing as I can’t do. If you decide what
        you want, you will do whatever it takes to get things done. You are passionate about everything you do, and you
        are kind with people around you. Your self-awareness allows you to self-correct, doesn’t stop you from making
        mistakes but challenge you to learn from them. You’re a champion for me."</p>
